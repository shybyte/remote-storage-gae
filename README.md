Remote Storage Provider running on Google App Engine

### Usage

Is coming soon...


### Development

I recommend to use Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) together with these plugins:
    * https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse
    * http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html

The appengine plugin will complain about missing jars in the libs directory.
This is intentional, as I did not wantend to commit this big heap of files.
You can use the appengine plugin (quickfix) to add this jars.
